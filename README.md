**Dictionary Search Application**
=================================

Using this Application, the User can create and Search a Dictionary of Words.

This Application has been implemented Using Trie Data Structure.

**Supported Operations**

The Current Version supports only 2 basic operations: 
- Word Insertion 
- Word Search

**What is expected in Future Release ?**
The next release will be packed with more features. Also, the current implentation is done using a Standard Trie Data Structure. I will be replacing the same with a Compressed Version.
